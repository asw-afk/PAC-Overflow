# PAC-Overflow

Pac-Overflow is a gaming website meant to encourage users to upvote posts based on content as opposed to user history. 

Once a user has made a post, another can comment below it to further the conversation piece posited by the original poster in what ever way they may so choose. 

Users are still required to make an account so that prior post history may be moderated.
